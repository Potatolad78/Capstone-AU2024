This does not include perfboards, wires, wiring tools, solder, soldering tools, or resistors. Those can be found below if you do not have them otherwise please skip past to the FILL IN NAME HERE section
### Perfboard or Breadboard?
Perfboards are used when you are creating electrical circuits and would like a stable connection that doesnt require having jumper cables. This
does require soldering for connection of pins which can be dangerous if unsupervised. This also allows for less errors as things are easier to 
break. If you are going with perfboards I recomend a breadboard layout as there are the easiest to use as they have power buses(See Vocabulary)
built in. If you are going to use perfboards I would recomend using a bread board to make sure that you have a good understanding of the 
electronics before soldering things into place.

You can find a good perfboard [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1609) for $4.50

Breadboards on the other hand are less permenant but can have issues with pins not touching metal properly and are often seens as temporary solutions.
As said above in the perfboard section one should at least use a breadboard to plan out their circuit so one could save money by only using breadboards.

### Wires or Jumpers?
Choosing between bbuying wires or jumpers is very difficult. If possible one should buy both as it allows for modularity when creating the ciruits however
if you can only afford one option then there are many things to consider.

#### What tools do I have acccess too?
If you have access to no tools and are trying to do this project without using any you are going to have a difficult time. If you are still going to try to
replicate the project without tools then you are going to want to go with jumpers as you wont have to wory as much about shortening them to the size that 
you need. However you will have to at least have access to solder for this project as not every module on the project has headers and to use jumpers you will
need to solder on headers. If you have access to things like wire cutters and wire strippers then normal wire should work perfectly. This will allow you to 
have more modularity and wires also just feel more professional.
