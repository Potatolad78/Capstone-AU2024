Initial Look:
Servo Works
Pump Works 
Light works
Sensor is taking readings
Valve is working
Clock does not work I believe that the wires were incorrectly done

I believe that we are where we used to be. This means that the known issues are present.

The pump needs a certain amount of water pressure to make sure that it is able to pump water. This is a known issue
The pump is not pumping the correct amount that I need. I need it to only pump up enough to fill the cuvette. Cuvette needs 3 ml to be full but that means we likely need even less to get a full reading. I think we will need maybe 2.5 ml.
 
The valve is not fully emptying out the cuvette.


1st Issue on the board is fixing the pump water pressure issue. I need it to be able to pump water to test the device

Pump is pushing water around 47 cm from the bottom of the pump4
Potential fix for the pump by cutting it shorter but you would still be able to work this with a stronger pump at a lower depth
For Clock I need to cut off the bottom of the clock or re solder it.
